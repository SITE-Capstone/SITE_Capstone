## Reflection Questions

Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - We sucessfully got the cron job to work in the backend & successfully deployed with calls to our backend. 

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- Our news API did not work in the front end, so to fix this, we moved our calls to the backend. 

Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did not finish the dropping of the wallet & the transaction history on the coinpage. 

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- The codepath deployment to heroku & surge page was really helpful with deploying. 

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- The blog feature & twitter features will not be done by the end of the program for sure.
