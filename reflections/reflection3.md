## Reflection Questions
Name at least one successful thing this week.
- This week, we succesfully managed to build and get the chron job running locally on our machines.

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- We found out that we may not get to publish our app in it's entirety due to the pricing model of Heroku. It only allows for so many cron operations per month. 

Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

- We overplanned our sprint plan this week and we also ran into the Heroku issue. 

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- We were provided serveral online resources that gave us information regarding CRON jobs. Here are those resources: 
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39057883/heroku-and-node-cron
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pg-migrate
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46404051/send-object-with-axios-get-request
- https://www.heroku.com/pricing#containers
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- We are most likely going to be scrapping the user story that involved sharing trading stradegies with other users in a blog.
