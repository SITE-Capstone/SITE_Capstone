## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

- We have a fully functioning build of the website that demoed really well.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

- We are still having issues with reaching the limit of api calls that we can make to the Coin Api. We have a solution that we will be working as a stretch feature to fix this issue. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

- 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

- 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
