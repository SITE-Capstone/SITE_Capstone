## Reflection Questions

Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - We were able to finish most of the backend this week apart from wallet transactions. 

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  - We faced a challenge relating to getting SQL tables to have a many to many relationship.  We also faced a situation where the our API calls in useEffect on our frontend weren't displaying the data properly. 

Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

  - We finished every single task in our first srpint and even managed to get started on some of the tasks for sprint 2. 

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

  - Stack Overflow
 -  Material UI documentation
  - CoinAPI documentation 

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- None
