## Problem Statement

Many investors see the potential and value of cryptocurrencies but do not own any crypto due to a lack of established trust or knowledge with the cryptocurrency market. We are building a learning platform to introduce new investors to crypto currencies and to build on the knowledge of inexperienced crypto investors.
