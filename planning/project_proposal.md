## Problem Statement

Many investors see the potential and value of cryptocurrencies but do not own any crypto due to a lack of established trust or knowledge with the cryptocurrency market. We are building a learning platform to introduce new investors to crypto currencies and to build on the knowledge of inexperienced crypto investors. 

## Description

Our platform will act as a learning platform for new investors to learn about and understand the tokenomics of different cryptocurrencies through a variety of means which include currated lessons/information, a paper trading simulator, and the latest aggregated news relating to cryptocurrencies. 

## Expected Features List

CORE FEATURES:

- View price charts of 10 different crypto currencies
- Display crypto tokenomics and basic info for each coin

- Ledger system for transactions
- User authentication to manage user wallets.
- Paper trade crypto currencies
- Tutorials to educate the user on cryptocurrency and trading

STRETCH FEATURES:

## Related Work

Similar paper trading apps exist for users to trade fake money, however these apps do not inheritely teach users aboout investing and are more used as a game. Apps in this space are also skewed towards stocks, where our app will be specific to cryptocurrency trading and focus on educating users while also allowing them to practice their newly learned investment strategies through paper trading of the top cryptocurrencies.

## Open Questions

- How do we gather information about different crypto currencies without having to hard code them ourselves?
- How do we create currated lessons?
- How should we plan the lessons?
