# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Xavier Loera Flores | Carlos Chavez**

## Problem Statement

Many investors see the potential and value of cryptocurrencies but do not own any crypto due to a lack of established trust or knowledge with the cryptocurrency market. We are building a learning platform to introduce new investors to crypto currencies and to build on the knowledge of inexperienced crypto investors. 

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

## Expected Features List


- View price charts of 10 different crypto currencies
- Display crypto tokenomics and basic info for each coin
- Login or SignUp 
- Paper trade crypto currencies
- Aggregated news columnn with news related to each crypto



## Related Work

Similar paper trading apps exist for users to trade fake money, however these apps do not inheritely teach users aboout investing and are more used as a game. Apps in this space are also skewed towards stocks, where our app will be specific to cryptocurrency trading and focus on eduacating users while also allowing them to practice their newly learned investment strategies through paper trading of the top cryptocurrencies.
