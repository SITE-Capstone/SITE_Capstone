## Project Overview

Many investors see the potential and value of cryptocurrencies but do not own any crypto due to a lack of established trust or knowledge with the cryptocurrency market. Our platform will act as a learning platform for new investors to learn about and understand the tokenomics of different cryptocurrencies through a variety of means which include currated lessons/information, a paper trading simulator, and the latest aggregated news relating to cryptocurrencies.
